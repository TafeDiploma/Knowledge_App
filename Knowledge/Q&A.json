				"title": "Dynamic variables",
				"description": "This is a description in detail of a dynamic variable",
				"question": "<p>Describe in detail dynamic variables</p>",
				"answer": "<p>Dynamic variable is a variable which the address is determined
									during runtime. Unlike a static variable which the memory for
									it is reserved at compilation time.</p>
									<p>This is a dynamic variable in C++ <br>
									<code><font color='blue'>int</font>* arr = new

				"question": "<p>Describe in detail medium-size application development</p>",
				"answer": "<p>Application development is process of the development of computer 
									programming, bug testing, and documenting resulting in a software
									product. The average size of a application development 
									team is 5 - 7 people.

				"answer": "<p>A standard array is a data structure consisting of a
									collection of elements, each one identified by at least one
									index or key. A arrat is positioned so each element can be
									computed fron its index tuple by a mathematical formula</p>
									<p>This is a C-Style array <br>

				"answer": "<p>Files store information for many purposes it represents a
									sequence of bytes on a disk where the group of related data is
									stored. In the C programming language it can handle files as
									data binary files and Stream oriented data like text files.</p>
									<p>This is writing text to a file in C++ <br>

									elements do not have to be of the same type. A user-defined data
									structure has fixed set of feilds defined by the user.</p>
									<p>This is a user-defined data struct in C++ <br>

				"description": "This is a description in detail of two development methodologies and their application",
				"question": "<p>Describe two development methodologies and their application</p>",
				"answer": "<p>The Waterfall model which is the classical approach, is a
									rigid and linear method. Distinct goals for each phase of development
									where after earch phase has completed the next one starts and there
									is no turning back. Waterfall model is more applicable where the
									project is small.</p>
									<p>The Spiral model focuses on early Identification and
									reduction of project risks. Spiral project starts on small scale
									which after exploring and handling risks then decides whether
									to take the next step in the project. Spiral model is more
									applicable where the project is large.</p>"

				"title": "Outline the principles of language development",
				"description": "This is a description in detail of principles of language development",
				"question": "<p>Outline the principles of language development</p>",
				"answer": "<p>Outline of the principles of language development:</p>
									<p>Principle 1: <b>Testing</b></p>
									<p>The testing of a piece of software if Principle to programming
									development, even if you think there if no way the piece of code
									(No matter how small) cannot break, think again. The smallest error
									in a large system can produce catastrophic problems even ones that
									are hard to detect unless properly tested.</p>
									<p>Principle 2: <b>Keep it simple, Stupid! (KISS)</b></p>
									<p>A design should be as simple as possible, but no simpler.
									Usually the more elegant a design, the simpler it is. It takes
									alot of work and iterations to simplify but the payoff is software
									that is less error-prone and maintainable.
									</p>
									<p>Principle 3: <b>Maintain the Vision</b></p>
									<p>A clear and uncompromising vision of a software system
									enforces compliance and helps ensure that the software project
									turns out successfully. Without vision and compromising results
									in patchwork system with conflicting designs.</p>"

				"title": "Outline the basic principles of project management",
				"description": "This is a description in detail of basic principles of project management",
				"question": "<p>Outline the basic principles of project management</p>",
				"answer": "<p>The basic principles of project management are as follows:</p>
									<ul>
										<li><b>Project Structure: </b>Revolves around three main
										parameters. Project Goal which is what has to be done.
										Project Timeline and Order which is a visualized start and end
										point of the project with all other packages.
										Project Milestones which are the certain phases of your project.</li>
										<li><b>Definition Phase: </b> Without a clear definition the
										project can go horribly wrong.</li>
										<li><b>Transparency About the Project Status: </b>Project
										manager should keep track of project and give short reports of
										project status to higher ups.</li>
										<li><b>Risk Recognition: </b>Identify risks early on to nip
										negative developments.</li>
										<li><b>Managing Project Disturbances: </b>Develop strategies
										to avoid or negate risks when possible.</li>
										<li><b>Responsibility Of The Project Manager: </b>Project
										manager develops the project plan with the team, secure acceptance
										and approval of deliverables from the Project Sponsor and
										Stakeholders.</li>

				"description": "This is a description in detail of the key features of the software development life cycle (SDLC)",
				"question": "<p>Describe the key features of the software development life cycle (SDLC)</p>",
				"answer": "<p>The key features are as follows:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Each phase of the life cycle has its own process that
										feeds into the next phase.</li>
										<li>When information becomes more available phases can overlap
										as previous phases are revisted.</li>
										<li>Iterative risk management system where as the project moves
										onto completion it increasingly becomes more developed.</li>

				"title": "Importance of software specifications",
				"description": "This is a description in detail of the importance of software specifications",
				"question": "<p>Describe the importance of software specifications</p>",
				"answer": "<p>The software Specification is a blueprint of what the client
									wants. Failure of producing a software specifications results
									in inadequatly producing the product that the client needs,
									and include unnecessary features. Inflating the cost of the
									project.</p>"

				"question": "<p>Identify the methods and importance of version control</p>",
				"answer": "<p>Version control is important for the ability to track each
									change as it was made, and to reverse any changes made. A method
									of version control is having a repository where and push,
									aync and pull files from it, you can do this through services
